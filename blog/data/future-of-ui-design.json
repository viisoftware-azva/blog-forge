    "content": "User Interface (UI) design is constantly evolving. As we move further into 2026, we're seeing a shift towards more immersive, tactile, and personalized experiences. Designers are moving away from the rigid flat design of the past decade and embracing new styles that bridge the gap between digital and physical worlds.\n\n## The Rise of Bento Grids\nOne of the most prominent trends this year is the widespread adoption of \"Bento Grids\". Inspired by Apple's marketing materials and the traditional Japanese bento box, this layout style organizes information into clean, rounded rectangular cells of varying sizes. It provides a sense of hierarchy and structure while remaining visually playful and modular.\n\n## Glassmorphism 2.0\nGlassmorphism isn't new, but it's becoming more refined. The new iteration focuses on subtle transparency, multi-layered frosted glass effects, and vivid colors that bleed through the translucent layers. This adds depth and a sense of \"virtual space\" to otherwise flat screens.\n\nAs we continue to build tools at Dev Space, these design principles guide our process, ensuring that every application we create is not only functional but also a joy to use."
