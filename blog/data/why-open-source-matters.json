    "summary": "Building community-driven software is no longer an option, it's a necessity for scalable projects.",
    "content": "Open source is the backbone of modern technology. In 2026, we see more companies than ever contributing to and relying on open-source projects to drive innovation and maintain security.\n\n## Community First\nThe power of open source lies in its community. When thousands of developers look at the same code, bugs are found faster and features are implemented more robustly.\n\n## Cost Effectiveness\nBy sharing the burden of development, organizations can focus their resources on building unique value on top of solid, shared foundations."
