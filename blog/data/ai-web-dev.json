    "content": "AI is no longer just a buzzword; it's a fundamental shift in how software is created. Tools like Copilot and specialized LLMs are now integrated into every developer's workflow.\n\n## Automated Code Generation\nModern AI agents can now handle boilerplate code, unit testing, and even complex bug fixes with surprising accuracy. This allows humans to focus on higher-level architecture and creative problem solving.\n\n## Personalized User Experiences\nBeyond coding, AI allows us to build interfaces that adapt to user behavior in real-time, creating truly personalized web experiences that were previously impossible.",
