    "summary": "How we managed to scale our cloud services to support millions of concurrent users worldwide.",
    "content": "Scaling for millions of users requires more than just adding more servers. It's about architecture, caching, and smart resource management.\n\n## Edge Computing\nBy moving computation closer to the user, we reduce latency and improve the overall experience of global applications.\n\n## Automated Scaling\nModern infrastructure should be able to breathe. It should expand during traffic peaks and contract during lulls to manage costs effectively."
